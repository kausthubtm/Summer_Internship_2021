# HOC Interpreter
Higher Order Calculator

Higher order calculator or just simply hoc is a programming language first introduced
by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike in their infamous book “The Unix Programming Environment”.
The book closes with a tutorial on hoc and demonstrates how to build interpreters.

Hoc’s basic functionality is to evaluate floating-point numerical expressions, e.g., “1+2*sin(0.7)”. Initialy hoc supported only a few basic operations like addition, subtraction ... But later on variables were added, conditionals, loops, user-defined functions, simple IO, and more, using a syntax resembling C.
There are six versions for hoc till now starting from hoc1 to hoc6 where enhancements and optimisations where made step by step. 

This repo contains an upgraded version of hoc6 and I call it **hoc7** :D !! .

## Upgardes

- Array functionality
- Matrix functionality
- For loop functionality
- Working on builtin function for sort

## Extra
- [This](https://github.com/kausthubtm/HOC) repo contains information and code of all the older versions of hoc. 
- Also, do check out my blog on hoc [here](https://kausthubtm.medium.com/higher-order-calculator-hoc-7781df55283b).
